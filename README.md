# PINC
## PINC is not Cisco Packet Tracer
**This is very much WIP!**

PINC (PINC is not Cisco Packet Tracer) is aiming to be a network simulation software designed to be easily extensible and easy to understand.

Just run it from your shell with "-c" to get the CLI for PINC.

A GTK Interface is in the making, the basic layout is there but nothing is actually funcioning, it can be invoked with the -g argument.
