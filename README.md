**This is very much WIP!**

PINC (PINC is not Cisco Packet Tracer) is aiming to be a network simulation software designed to be easily extensible and easy to understand.

Just run it from your shell with "-c" to get the CLI for OPNS.
There will be a GTK frontend at some point when all the basics work.
